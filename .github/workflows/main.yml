# CI Workflow for building and pushing a Docker image
#
# This workflow is triggered on push events to the `main` branch.
# It builds a Docker image using the `docker build` command and pushes it to a registry.
#
# Example:
# This workflow can be used to automate the build and deployment of a Go application.
# For example, if you have a Go application in the `main` branch of your repository,
# this workflow will build a Docker image with the latest code changes and push it to a registry.
